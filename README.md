Title: CuEARated Cuisine

Project description: 

As “stay-at-home” restrictions continue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity for people to cook at home is greater than ever before.

Our application allows users the opportunity to select a number of celebrity chefs provided and have gifs of those chefs appear, recreate the experience of dining at a restaurant by providing them with a variety of cuisines, and creating ambiance with curated music, all in the comfort of their own home.
